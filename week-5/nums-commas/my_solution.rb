# 0. Pseudocode

# INPUT: Positive Integer
# OUTPUT: A postive interger with a comma to sperated integer and returned as string ex: "1,000"

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
  # Create a method called separate comma. The method takes a positive integer as argument
  # I want argument to take in positive integers
  # The integer can not be less then 0(negative number) it will fail
  # When the number is less then 4 digits long return the number as a string
  # When the number is greater then 3 digits long return the number as a string place a comma after the first digit.

# 1. Initial Solution
def separate_comma(integer)
  num = integer.to_s
  if
    integer = rand(0..999)
      return integer.to_s
  elsif
    integer = rand(1000..9999)
      return integer.to_s
  elsif
    integer = rand(10000..99999)
      return integer.to_s
  elsif
    integer = rand(100000..999999)
      return integer.to_s
  elsif
    integer = rand(1000000..9999999)
      return integer.to_s
     elsif
    integer = rand(1000000..9999999)
      return integer.to_s
  end
