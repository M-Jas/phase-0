// There is two different groups of numbers. The first group has a odd amount of numbers in it. The second group has an even amount.

// 1)As the user I am trying create a function that checks for the sum(total) amount in each of the two different group. The sum is the result of adding two or more numbers together.

// 2)The first sum we are trying to find is based on an odd amount of individual numbers in the First group. You can find the mean by taking the average of the numbers
// 3)The second sum we are trying to find is based on an even amount of individual numbers in the Second group.

// 4) As the user I am trying create a second function that will check the for the mean(average) number in each of the two different groups.

// 5)The first Mean number we are trying to find is based on an odd amount of individual numbers in the First group.
// 6)The second Mean number we are trying to find is based on an even amount of individual numbers in the Second group.

// 7)As the user I am trying create a third and final function that will check two different collections for the median number in each one. To find the median you would put the numbers into value order high to low and select the middle number.

// 8)The first median(middle) number we are trying to find is based on an odd amount of individual numbers in the First group.
// 9)The second median(middle)  number we are trying to find is based on an odd amount of individual numbers in the Second group.
