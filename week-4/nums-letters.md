##What does puts do?
Puts String(puts): only prints(gives) the output and adds a new line on the console.

##What is an integer? What is a float?
-Interger is a number that does not have any decimal points.(ex: 1   10   34599999999)
-Float is a number that has decimal points (ex: 1.13   3.14   -589.002)

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
The difference is that an integer will round down to a whole number, while the float will keep and dispaly the decimal point in the number. I would ask the person how exact they are looking the answer to be, if they want to know what the decimal outcome will be use float. If they are looking to get the idea(a rounded number) of what the answer is going to be go for the integer.
A float would say the average family has something like 2.4 child per household. There would be little Billy, Sally, and then there is Carl who is only .4 of a person. That does not sound right or fair... Use the interger and say there is 2 kids per household. (I heard this in a movie please dont think I am crazy)
