What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?Know and understand where the file lives and the proper path. We had some issues for about 15 minutes trying to get my relative path to link the html to css.  The issues is was my filed lived in a different location compared to my peer's. We had to go one more directory up to get mine linked.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it? Not sure if this is the best practice, but we added more <p> tags to help with the placement of all the lines. It was not that hard, it was more about the trial and error process. I know I will have issues recalling what selectors and properties will need to be used and when.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.) Span: used it to make the B/H larger in the title. Float: to move groups of the content to where we needed them. We also used color, background color; sudo-class selectors, borders, and margins.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML? Originally the websites were made into  a few larger sections, we decided the best way to modify the html is to break it down into smaller sections.  The way we did this was by adding sections, classes, and a footer.


When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why? I thought our was better looking. It seemed a bit more clean and neatly laid out.  The website we based ours on had older html in it (font size in the html) which made it harder to read and make a duplicate of. The HTML5 really shined during the process and  made the tasks so much easier to accomplish ours.
