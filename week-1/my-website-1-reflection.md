#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
A Step-by-step worked best for me.
1) Head to www.github.com and sign in or create a new account.
2)On the lower right side of the first screen click the +new repository button.
2) Fill in a repository(repo) name section.
3) Check the Public option to make your repo open to the public.
4)Your Repo has been created. Congrats keep going!
5)On the bottom right side of the screen, you will see a small box with a Web ID for Cloning. Copy this URL.
6) Head to your terminal. If you dont know what the terminal is please search for it in your computers search bar.
7)Once it is open, please type the following then paste the URL after it and hit enter: git clone YOURURL
8) Look at what you just did! You cloned a Repo.



#Describe what open source means.
Open Source is computer software that is open to the public to use freely

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open Source is fantastic way for this community to rally around eachother by providing suport, growth, and inspiration. Open source does not make me feel protective but maybe nervous. The only reason I feel nervous is because I feel that people may try to abuse the system, but that seems far fetched.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are highly important because they are going to protect you and your work in certain parameters, and they will makes sure that you will be given credit, when credit is due.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I made a cheat sheet on pushing and pulling, so when I am walking to work, I repeated all the commands out loud(not loud enough for people to hear) to pass the time. The "aha" came when my webpage went active, something has just clicked in my head. Only thing I am really struggling with is where I should be creating new branches. I am a neat freak so I am worrying if I am putting them in the correct place.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Sometimes I need an idea spoken to me to truly grasp it. I found a really good documentary about the creation of open source and what is has been through. Within 3 minutes, the video explained what open source is.
