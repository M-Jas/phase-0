# 1.1 Think About Time
At this point, I can admit I truly do not mange my time affectively. This method, or lack there of, works for me somewhat. If I have a task, I will usually set aside time from x until y, with no expectations for completing the task. This leaves me with a great amount of time for error and slacking off. Some of the new methods I plan on using to improve my overall Time Management are better mindfulness, state of flow, and Timebox. Since I give myself too much time to work, the Timebox could help me accomplish more for DBC in shorter amounts of time. The Timebox would require me to set a hard deadline for me to finish the homework. Going forward, I am going to start meditating more so I can coherently adjust my mindfulness and address the outside factors that distract me, create a more personal work flow structure, and use the Timebox to regulate my time spent on work.

## 1.2 The Command Line
Shell and  Bash  are command line systems that can be similar and different at the same time. They are similar because they both provide an interface with the user(keyboard input) and the computer operating system (causing an output). Bash and Shell are different because they work on different operating systems and have different commands at times. I was able to execute most of the commands that we just practiced, however tI had some difficulties with pushd and popd commands.  These two commands were harder for me to grasp because I tend to think linearly, while these let you move around a bit more randomly. The two commands I see being the most critical are mikdir and cd. Without mikdir and cd we would not be able to create new programs, because we would only be continually working in one directory.

-pwd: Print working directory or show where we are working in the computer.

-ls: List the directories and files at you current location in the system

-mv: moving or renaming a file

-cd: Change Directory or change/move around where you are at in the computer files.

-../: moving up in the file path. for each ../ it is one file

-touch: create a new empty file.

-mkdir: Make a new directory

-less: Shows you what is in a file by stoping what is going on and go to a new page.

-rmdir: Remove directory

-rm: removes single files

-help: Assistance within commands in the terminal.
