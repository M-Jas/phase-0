# 1.1 Think About Time
At this point, I can admit I truly do not mange my time affectively. This method, or lack there of, works for me somewhat. If I have a task, I will usually set aside time from x until y, with no expectations for completing the task. This leaves me with a great amount of time for error and slacking off. Some of the new methods I plan on using to improve my overall Time Management are better mindfulness, state of flow, and Timebox. Since I give myself too much time to work, the Timebox could help me accomplish more for DBC in shorter amounts of time. The Timebox would require me to set a hard deadline for me to finish the homework. Going forward, I am going to start meditating more so I can coherently adjust my mindfulness and address the outside factors that distract me, create a more personal work flow structure, and use the Timebox to regulate my time spent on work.

## 1.2 The Command Line
Shell and  Bash  are command line systems that can be similar and different at the same time. They are similar because they both provide an interface with the user(keyboard input) and the computer operating system (causing an output). Bash and Shell are different because they work on different operating systems and have different commands at times. I was able to execute most of the commands that we just practiced, however tI had some difficulties with pushd and popd commands.  These two commands were harder for me to grasp because I tend to think linearly, while these let you move around a bit more randomly. The two commands I see being the most critical are mikdir and cd. Without mikdir and cd we would not be able to create new programs, because we would only be continually working in one directory.

-pwd: Print working directory or show where we are working in the computer.

-ls: List the directories and files at you current location in the system

-mv: moving or renaming a file

-cd: Change Directory or change/move around where you are at in the computer files.

-../: moving up in the file path. for each ../ it is one file

-touch: create a new empty file.

-mkdir: Make a new directory

-less: Shows you what is in a file by stoping what is going on and go to a new page.

-rmdir: Remove directory

-rm: removes single files

-help: Assistance within commands in the terminal.


### Forking and Cloning
Snapple Fact's of git/GitHub instructions.

Create New Repo Git: In your Bash type the git init command followed by what you want to name the repo and Snap you are done.
Create New Repo GitHub: Work your way to the GitHub site. Once you are there, look for the Plus "+" sign in the top right side. Please go there and click the +, then select New Repo, and then follow the instructions on the next page.

Fork a Repo: While on GitHub go to the  a new Repo you would like to add to your profile. Look to the upper right side of the site and see a box labeled Fork.  Please click the Fork(the word not the utensil), then pick your profile and Snap you should have the repo in no time.

Clone From GitHub to Git: In the lower right side of you screen on GitHub you should see a box with a URL in it that says Clone. Copy the URL that is below and head back over to your Terminal. Once you are in the terminal run pwd to see where you are at in the computer. If you need to move to a different area hit cd what ever directory. Once you are in the file you want to add the repo to please  run git clone http://github.com/whateverneame (Links to an external site.) (paste the URL needed) and Snap you are done.

The fork method is ideal because it lets you take an existing repo and add it to your account and then to your computer. This will grant you access to make contributions or start working on something new. Or you could always start from scratch if you like.

I struggled a bit with where I should be cloning the new repos. After watching the video I thought we had to create a few directories and place the new repos inside them, but this was not the goal of the exercise. I placed the two new repos in my main directory.
