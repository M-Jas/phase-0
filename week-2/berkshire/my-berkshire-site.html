 -What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
 Very hard. The initial information we got for the HTML section was very generic and did not have the best examples. I read it and thought it would have been enough but it was not.

 -How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
   I also had some big issues here. I could not get the html info to stick. After an hour I found this website: http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html and it spells everything out step by step.

-How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I did really well once I figured out what was needed for the exercises. I am very ridged about organization and it helped me with the structure of the doc.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
   HTML is a very readable language and this makes it easy to understand what is going on in each line. Also there is not a massive amount of tags for html/html5, which makes it easier because we don't have to remember a large amount of tags. However since there is so few tags html can look receptive. You can have hundreds of divs, sections, and articles which will start to blend in together.I did have issues with the relative path not letting my img come from a difrent folder.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
   For the first time since this has started, I don't have any trick for html. I am trying to just remember the flow of the html structure and I work off that.
