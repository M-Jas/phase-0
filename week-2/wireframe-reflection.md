##What is a wireframe?
Wireframe can be seen as the blueprint design for you website. It is the 30,000ft view of the layout and interaction of your website free of distraction such as color, fonts, and pictures. Wireframes can be made by using wireframing software tools like gliffy(which I used and disliked) or just simple free hand sketches.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?
*Avoids Tunnel Vision
*Saves Money
*Increases Effectiveness and Use Ability
*Making Design Changes Effortless

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yes and No! I have always wanted to be more creative and this gave me an opportunity to use parts of my brain I have not used in years.  The reason I did not like wireframing the site was due to the tool I used Gilffy. In the interest of saving time I Gliffy because it was on our reading requirements and it is suggested as a top free 10 pick. It lagged very badly and it took me way longer than it should have to finish my layouts.

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I actually did some thumbnails first, then I used the Gliffy for a clean copy.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
How detailed should this be? How can I make mine different?  I used our reading but as always I like to watch videos on these new subjects, the following video was long but very good.

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I really enjoyed the opportunity to brainstorm and draw about what my site is going to look like. Nothing was to tedious, but I can see how someone could get sucked into a rabbit hole.
